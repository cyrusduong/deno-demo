# [Deno](https://deno.land/)

The all-in-one TS/JS runtime
Since we already talked about [bun](https://bun.sh/), the *other, newer* TS/JS runtime.

# Preface and Credit

A *lot* of this was just put together based on the Deno manual, and Ryan Dahl's talk @ Remix Conf 2022.

If you find any of this interesting please check his talk out [here](https://youtu.be/3NR9Spj0DmQ)

# A Great DX (developer experience)  

<!-- _footer: bundling not meant for web ATM, recommends ESBuild for shipping browser JS -->

[Install](#install) as a single executable/binary and out-of-box Deno provides

- Fast for DX (it was until bun showed up)
- config-less (test, lint, fmt)
- Secure
- ES Module loading via URLs (no package manager required)
- Bundling*/Installing "apps"
- Go to reference (web modules)

# IDE Integrations

Deno provides a language server out of the box that can integrate with the [Language server protocol](https://langserver.org/) and provides amazing [plugin/extension support for modern IDEs](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment#using-an-editoride).

- [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
- [Jetbrains IDE Plguin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14382-deno)
- [Vim/Neovim LSP Plugins](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) - `deno lsp`

# Demo

```sh
deno run serve.ts
```
 

---

# Running "apps" from web

```sh
deno run https://deno.land/std/examples/welcome.ts
```

What about a WebSocket chat server and simple client?

```sh
deno run https://deno.land/std@0.149.0/examples/chat/server.ts
```

---

# Installable "apps"!


What was my public ip again?
```
deno install --allow-net myip.ts
```

```sh
deno install --allow-net fetch.ts
```

ðŸ¤” Can we install `deno` using our own `fetch` implementation?

```
fetch https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

---

# Built in toolchain with IDE integration

We can format, lint, test using CLI or extensions!

Formatting react 18 minified to something readable

```sh
deno fmt unformatted.ts
```

Linting and Testing whenever & wherever

```sh
deno lint unformatted.ts
deno test benchmarks/deno.ts
```

---

# Benchmarks

Testing is fast (I think...)

```
deno task benchmark
```

# Now the *really* cool demo (Deno Deploy)

* Lets make our own [blog](https://deno.land/x/blog@0.3.3)
* That's SSR, no client-JS
* Using markdown for "pages"
* Deployed on the web [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)
* At the edge in [32 regions](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/regions)
* No to/little build-time to "prod"

<!-- This shouldn't take long... -->
